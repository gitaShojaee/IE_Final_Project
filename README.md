To create follow the steps below:

1.open CMD and type django-admin startproject “name of the project”

2.Now go to the setting.py and copy the SECRET_KEY.

3.Navigate to the cloned folder and open the setting.py and paste the copied SECRET_KEY.

4.Then open the cmd in that folder and do the migration part and also create the superuser by the following commands.
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
5.Now the last thing is that just go to the cloned project and run the project by writing the following command in the CMD.
